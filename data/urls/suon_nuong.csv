Spring is one of my favorite seasons of the year minus the allergies of course. April showers bring May flowers but also a myriad of allergens prior to the brilliant bloom. My daughters and I have allergies year round but it's significantly worse during this season. But despite the itchy and watery eyes, congestion and sneezing, spring in all of its natural glory beckons us outside into our backyard for some barbecuing and I couldn't do it because the darn allergies were so bad. That's what we get for being confined to the valley. So yesterday I managed to create a new baked baby back rib recipe for my family to enjoy after a few weeks of eating out with much less healthy food. The ribs were served with these beautiful, tender, and tasty roasted garlic organic baby squash and sweet peppers. On an earlier post on my Facebook page, I alluded to carrot sticky rice with a hint of coconut fragrance, so that was incorporated as a lovely side dish. My girls and husband thought these finger lickin' baby back ribs were so yummy. They're tender, moist and the meat falls right off the bone. The ribs were brushed with the thickened sauce - which is a mixture of the sauce from baked ribs mixed with corn starch - and left to broil for a few minutes until it's cooked on and bubbly. The recipe couldn't be any simpler. Give it a go! * RECIPE: Sườn Nướng Printable Recipe * Ingredients 6-7 lb Pork Loin Backribs 1 cup Brown Sugar 1 cup Honey Barbecue Sauce 1/4 cup Olive Oil 1/4 cup Soy Sauce 2 tablespoons Fish Sauce 2 tablespoons Lime Juice 1 tablespoon Onion Powder 1/2 tablespoon Black Pepper 1 whole Garlic 2 tablespoons Corn Starch * DIRECTIONS Preheat oven to 300 degrees F * Preparing Ribs Peel off tough membrane that covers the bony side of the ribs. Rinse and cut ribs into smaller portions of about 4 or 6 ribs. Set aside. * Preparing Sauce In a large mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients except the corn starch. Mix well. * Baking Ribs Dip ribs into the sauce and lay ribs in a deep baking pan with the bony side up. Lay a layer of foil on top of ribs and roll and crimp edges tightly. Bake for 2 1/2 hours or until meat is starting to shrink away from the ends of the bone. Remove from oven. Transfer ribs onto a broiler pan. Pour the sauce into a sauce pan. * Cooking Sauce Scoop out the fatty layer on top of the sauce and discard. In a small bowl, add corn starch and some sauce to mix the corn starch. Set aside. Bring the sauce pan to a boil. Reduce heat and add corn starch mixture. Mix well. The sauce should be thickened. * Broiling Ribs or Grilling Ribs Cut ribs into serving sized portions of 2 or 3 ribs. Arrange on broiler pan, bony side up. Brush on sauce. Broil for 3-4 minutes until sauce is cooked on and bubbly. Turn ribs over. Brush sauce on the other side and broil for another 3-4 minutes. Instead of broiling, you can grill them in your back yard. * Presentation Serve ribs with your favorite side dishes . . . and maybe a beer?"
